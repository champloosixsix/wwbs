I contacted him. After our conversation he said he would help me. Mr. Lewis took
me step by step filing my claim on Ebenefits web site because I was lost. Mr.
Lewis put me on the correct path and with his help in filing my claim I went from a
20% to a 70% rating. His understanding a knowledge is in great demand many
veterans could benefit from a person like him. I highly recommend anyone that is

                  I had previously filed a VA disability Claim in 2009 when I got out of the military but had been
                  denied due to my failure to complete the process. I was already evaluated but no rating was
                  established. The reason(s) for not completing the process at the time was, an employment
                  opportunity in Kuwait presented itself and I had to leave, and the process was never
                  completed.
                  
                  10 years later, in August 2018, I was introduced to Mr. Willie Lewis as a VA Specialist who was
                  willing to render his services for a fee. He was very gracious in helping me re-open my VA
                  disability Claims. After a year of medical examination and evaluation, I was awarded a 100%
                  disability rating from the veteran Administration. I would like to take this opportunity to
                  express my deepest gratitude to Mr. Lewis for his assistance in helping me navigate the process
                  which led to a successful resolution. All praises be to Allah.

                  I would like to take this opportunity to express my deepest gratitude to one of our own--a
Veteran, that has really made a difference for us here in Kuwait. I've been in this country
for over four years, and I must say that when anyone has a need for Veterans Assistance
they MUST reach out to Mr. Willie Lewis. He is a true Professional and great source of
insight and information when dealing with the Veterans Administration. His
comprehension with the processes and procedures are instrumental in reaching favorable
outcomes with VA claims—a testaments of his vast knowledge and experience. I say this
because within a 90 day period, Mr. Lewis was able to get me a 60% rating, for starters.
Throughout the process he guided me without a fail to identify injuries, which I never
thought would be considered for a claim. I have always heard many of my comrades
talked of VA claims and the difficulties it has been to reach positive outcome. Well, am
here to tell you that Willie “Lew” Lewis is the key to getting your VA claims resolved
satisfactorily. He has made a difference for me and I am sure he’ll make a difference for
you as well. My aim, with the assistance of Willie Lewis, is to gradually achieve a 100%
rating. He has been a great source of knowledge and help beyond expectations.

                  Hello All!
I just wanted to take a few minutes of your time. 
I started this journey 23 years ago. Trying to get my 100% disability from the Military. I went from the following percentage 60%, 80%, and 90% for a very long time. I just settled with that amount. My cousin Walter   told me to try this guy. I have spent so much money trying to get my 100%.  Told my cousin that I would try this guy. Well God be the Glory in 90 days after work with this guy. I got my 100%. 
To anyone that wants help with filing their  military  disability claims. This guy can do wonders. His name is Willie Lewis. Thank you Willie for helping me. I will pass your information to anyone that wants help. Thanks again cousin Walt and Mr. Willie Lewis. God be the Glory!

process and procedures of getting positive results in claim and other features. My personal
dealings with Mr. Lewis got me a 60% rating in less than 90 days and now | am at 80% with

dealings with the Veterans Administration and his consultant service fee is nothing compared
to what your results will be in the end.

                  In September 2017 I finally filed for compensation with assistance from a DAV Rep. In March 2018, all 7 disability claims were denied. I requested & received my service and medical records in October 2018, and with the help of Mr Lewis and his Company I was able to  file my Fully Developed Claims on 11 March 2019. For my first FDC for PTSD, I was scheduled for a C&P Exam & attended it on 07 April. On 16 April, I received my DVA letter awarding me 30%! So far, all 7 of my FDC's are progressing through "the system". Again, it took a lot of research, time, & documentation to put the FDC's together; but Mr. Lewis was with me every step of the way, talking to me, telling me how to file everything, and how to understand the steps of the VA. The end results are very positive. And now I am at 80%....<br>

Thank you Lew you are the very Best.

                  Thanks to Mr. Lewis, I went from 0% to 70% disability rating with just one claim decision, a remarkable achievement considering my previous setbacks. With other claims still pending, I have complete confidence that Mr. Lewis will continue to fight tirelessly on my behalf.<br>

                  I cannot recommend Mr. Lewis and Wounded Warrior Battle Systems highly enough. If you're navigating the VA disability claims process, look no further. Mr. Lewis is a true advocate who goes above and beyond to ensure veterans receive the benefits they deserve.

                  I am a young veteran with service-connected PTSD from serving in the US Army. The VA had purposely excluded multiple symptoms from my C&P Exam and supporting documents, and gave me an unfairly low disability rating. Feeling discouraged and betrayed by the system, I reached out to multiple companies to help me with the strenous VA appeal process. Since I am a young veteran, every company I spoke with declined my case because of their contingency fee would be smaller due to me being recently seperated from Active Duty. Thankfully, Wounded Warrior Battle Systems took my case because he honestly wants to help veterans, and isn't in it just for the money. It took over 6 months to resolve, but in the end I won my appeal. Wounded Warrior Battle Systems was amazing to work with along the way. If I had not worked with them, i would have given up a long time ago. Thank you Wounded Warrior Battle Systems, so much!<br>
